# Food Delivery Website Project

Welcome to the "Food Delivery Website Project" repository! This project is a culmination of my efforts to create a user-friendly and visually appealing food delivery website using HTML and CSS. Within this repository, you'll find the code files used to build the website, including HTML markup for structuring the pages and CSS stylesheets for styling and layout.

The website features several key functionalities to enhance the user experience. Users can navigate to the menu page to explore a variety of dishes available for order. Additionally, the "most ordered" page provides insights into popular menu items, helping users make informed decisions about their orders. The order page allows users to place their orders seamlessly, providing a convenient way to satisfy their cravings from the comfort of their own homes.

This project has been instrumental in helping me sharpen my frontend skills. Through designing and implementing the website's layout, styling elements, and incorporating interactive features, I've gained valuable experience in creating engaging user interfaces. Moreover, working on this project has allowed me to deepen my understanding of HTML and CSS fundamentals, reinforcing concepts such as semantic markup, responsive design, and CSS specificity.

Overall, the "Food Delivery Website Project" has been an enriching journey that has not only expanded my technical abilities but also fueled my passion for frontend development. I'm excited to continue refining and enhancing this project, and I hope it serves as a valuable resource for those looking to explore the world of web development.
